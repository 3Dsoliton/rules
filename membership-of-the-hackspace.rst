Membership of the Hackspace
===========================

We ask that you gauge your membership by putting more back into the Hackspace than you take out in use. **The hackspace costs an average of £4.34 per hour to run**.

Members who need to contribute more to the Hackspace may be asked to do so.

Should you bring guests to the Hackspace regularly, please **ensure your membership fees cover their access** and usage of the Hackspace.

When a member stops paying their standing order, they will become an Ex-Member. **An ex member will be provided notification of such**, and **their members box will be emptied** within 2 months of the last standing order payment. This initial £5 is non refundable If you decide to no longer be a member, please empty your box first. The Hackspace will buy it back from you as long as it is undamaged.

**Members must follow and agree to all rules**, and membership can be revoked through the grievance procedure.
