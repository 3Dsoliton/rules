Do Not Hack
===========

Do Not Hack is an integral part of the Hackspace. <This doesnt not explain what DNH is>

When labelling something with Do Not Hack your label must include:
* Name
* Description of project
* Contact Email
* Shelf Location (if on the colour coded large project shelves)
* Date Started
* Date Predicted for Project End

**Infrastructure and tools** may be labelled and shouldnâ€™t be hacked.

When a project is left unlabelled, the Trustees or other members may note this, and **mark it as unlabelled**. If something remains unlabelled for 3 months, it **will be disposed of**.
