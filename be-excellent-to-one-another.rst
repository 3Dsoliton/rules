Be Excellent To One Another
===========================

We ask that you respect others when using the Hackspace. Do this by **cleaning up after yourself**, abiding by our **safe spaces** [#]_ policy and **code of conduct** [#]_.

Tasks that always require extra help are emptying the bins and recycling, loading and unloading the dishwasher and keeping our electricity usage down by turning lights off. Remember we ask all members to put in a little more to the Hackspace than they take out - so clean up after others, not just yourself.

Please make yourself aware of our **grievance policy** [#]_.

Remember that the Hackspace is run by the volunteers for the members, and we ask that you be a **member not a consumer**. Donâ€™t be a greedy hacker.
