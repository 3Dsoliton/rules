Storage in the Hackspace
========================

Remember that the **Hackspace has limited storage space**. We have designated storage space for **consumables, resources** and **members’ storage**.

Members are entitled to a **35l storage box**. You can buy a box from any of the Membership Team or Trustees for £5. You must label your box with your full name - please do not use a pseudonym. A contact method (such as email) is also appreciated on the label, to help identify the owner of a box.

If you are working on a project that is too large for a 35l box you can store it on the Large Project Shelves. It can be stored there whilst it is actively being worked on, and must always be labelled according to our **Do Not Hack** rules.

If your project is too big for the Large Project Shelves, a storage request must be made on the Google Group.

If you wish to **store solvents**, they must be stored in the members’ section of the solvents cupboard. Please see **Rule 0** for details.

If you use the **spray booth**, you can of course leave your project to dry in the spray booth for up to 24 hours, however please ensure it is labelled with a Do Not Hack sign as well as being aware it may need to be moved to accommodate use of the booth.

Chemicals, solvents and flammables must always be labelled and kept in appropriate, sealed containers. Flammable liquids (oils, solvents, cleaning fluids etc.) should be kept in the **solvents cupboard**.

If you are bringing in solvents, they must be stored appropriately. This is in the members’ section of the **solvents cupboard**. Do not store solvents in your members box or on the Large Project Shelves.
Solvents must be labelled appropriately and sealed appropriate. Store in appropriate containers (ideally the one it came in).

You can find more information about bike storage here <link to wiki with below info>.

In respect of our bike racks:

You are welcome to use the racks to store your bike in the ‘space if:
* You are hacking in the space and using the space
* You want a safe place to leave your bike if you want to walk into town to shop/go to the cinema etc for a short period of time (ie, a morning or an afternoon)

You should not be using the bike racks:
* For storing a bike for more than a day
* As storage for a project you’re working on
* Whilst you go to work every day (Nottingham City Council operate Citycard Cycle Hubs for this purpose)
